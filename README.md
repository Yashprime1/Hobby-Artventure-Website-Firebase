# Brief Summary :

## Decription :

This is a website which is meant for all the artists to connect with each other 

## How I implemented it in short :

1) Made use of MongoDB, and express framwork with nodejs
2) Implemented a form for artists to find hirers
3) Then a form for hirers/ fellow artists to find artists like singer,dancer,musician for their group
4) Finally in the index.js from the inputs for a form I've filtered the results for our user
5) Then I've hosted it on heroku 

## Output :

[!website](https://artventure07.herokuapp.com/)
